Key Differences: RCS vs SMS vs WhatsApp
‚Ä¢	RCS offers richer messaging features such as images, read receipts, and interactive elements. However, both the sender and receiver must have RCS-capable devices and network support.
‚Ä¢	SMS is universal and works on all phones with SIM support, but it lacks advanced features like read receipts, media sharing, and interactive buttons.
